    <h4 className="vertical-timeline-element-subtitle">Introduction to Creative technology</h4>
    <p>
    First meeting, Everybody talked about  what makes them unique and the course got explained.<br />
    Think & Make is Creative technology.
    <br /> <br />
    Watched a documentary with the whole class, about creativity.
    <br />
    The project should be life changing, change the way people do something.<br />
    “If you want to learn something, failure isn’t something to be endured, it should be embraced”
    <br /> <br />
    Duo project is gonna be some kind of speed dating, interesting
    <br /> <br /> 
    Cool innovative projects, that help people that’s at the core it seems.
    Innovate to improve!

    I explained 2 of my ideas:<br /> 1. a smart basement / storage cabinet. <br/>2. my allergy restaurant reservation.
    <br /> <br />
    Explored the possibilities with technology that currently exist and what will be possible in the future.<br />

    <p>
    Brainstorm session, What if I can, …. (change)(Humanity + technology),  Decide what to focus on.
    <br /> <br />
    Google voice restaurant reservation with allergies.(Google voice and app, would need an API / server) <br />
    What if I, Change the way people with allergies go out for dining. <br />
    What means change the way, People with allergies get dishes that look and feel and taste great and are not just a main dish with the allergy taken out.
    <br /> <br />
    Smart basement(Storage cabinet)(Camera recognition and app) <br />
    What if I, Change the way people keep up with the things they have available in the house? Make it easier for people to know What to get from the grocery store. <br />
    <br />
    Helped some classmates with thinking of project visions.
    <br /> <br />
    Feedback for my ideas:
    Too good to go idea, less waste for restaurants.
    Think about naming the assistant.
    <br /> <br />
    What is vision? Workshop.<br />
      A vision is someone’s idea of the future and someone’s look at the future.
      <br /><br />
Personal opinion of tech visionars top 3<br />
1. Steve Jobs<br />
2. Bill Gates<br />
3. Elon Musk<br />
<br />
A vision has to do with direction, meaning and purpose.
<br />
Created 2 vision boards. One for my projects and one for my general vision for creative technology.

    <p>
    Introduction start about Individual project by teacher.<br /> 
      - Dive into the subject of your choice<br /> 
      - Describe your project<br /> 
      - Make a planning<br /> 
      - Start exploring<br /> 
      - Describe your needs.<br /> 
    Brainstorming in breakout rooms with pep<br /> 
    <br /> 
    <br /> 
    Workshop creating a Creative technology manifest. <br /> 
    A manifest is a short list of rules / visions of a way of being. For example the 10 rules of Christianity in the Bible. <br /> 
    We read an article about creative technology and split up into groups to create our own versions of a creative technology manifesto.  <br /> 
    We combined the manifest lines from each group into 1 for the whole class. <br /> 
     Tomorrow we are going to visualize it / make a cool looking version of this manifest. <br /> 
    <br />  <br /> 
- A creative technologist <br /> 
~ “it’s someone who is a bit creative, has some good experience with technology and bridges the gap between the two” <br /> 
<br />
An interesting note I agreed with ~ “Final polish is important because if a person didn’t care enough to fix those small things, why should a user respect the experience?”
<br /> <br /> 
The article we read was really interesting <a href="https://medium.com/@laserpilot/advice-for-creative-technologists-21f3f220b2">Article link</a>

    Researching the possibilities I have to realize my individual project, an automated dart counting system.<br />
    Found a few interesting projects I could work with. I think of doing a 2 camera approach, since a 4 camera approach would be way more expensive. There is also a possibility to do a 1 camera approach, but I think a 2 camera triangulation method is a very good middle ground.<br />
    <br />
    Talked with the teacher about the possible options on detecting darts since I couldn’t come to a conclusion on how to go about it.<br />
    The result is this drawing by teacher, explaining the triangulation of the dart position based on board size.<br />

    <p>
    Workshop how to learn new tech.<br />
    Learned something about ubiquitous technology (IOT devices). Tech that’s all around us and not really noticable.<br />
    Why do tech research? Substantiate choices. Be able to show your efforts to make your story believable and trustworthy.<br />
    Start formulating a question for your research.<br />
￼   <br />
    Also had my semester coach introduction with Geert Jan van Ouwendorp.<br />

    <p>
    Doing some more research and writing down things that need to be done so that this project can succeed
    ￼<br />
    I’m thinking of doing the detection with triangulation, 1 camera sees the whole board from the top another sees the whole board from the side.<br />
    Then I can point a coordinate point on a x y axis. And use this <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/167440/score-a-single-dart">Example</a> to know what the thrown score is.<br />
    The dartboard has a diameter of 34cm.<br />
    <br />
    Parts to make<br />
    - dart index on x - y axis<br />
    - Calculate dart score based on index<br />
    - Game of darts code<br />
    - Control the game of darts.<br />

    <h3 className="vertical-timeline-element-title">Workshop fire starters, what are your CoreStrengths? And how to unlock them.</h3>
    <h4 className="vertical-timeline-element-subtitle">Group meeting about progress and continuing work on individual project</h4>
    <p>
    I Read the document and I think the 2 that fit with me are:<br />
    <br />
      Dream:<br />
      Dream stands for creativity, following your own path, openness, curiosity, liveliness and likes to make jokes. For you, the world is more than an average voyage of discovery. It is possible that you love travel above average and your curiosity will take you further. <br />
      Some examples of DREAM CoreStrengths: exceptional / mindful / searching / spontaneous <br />
      <br />
      Do:<br />
      Do stands for grounded, down-to-earth, building and arranging things, be thorough, look realistically at the world. You. Live quite effectively and can inspire others with that. It’s very nice to leave things up to you, you make sure it’s all right. You have a lot of growth capacity.<br /> 
      Some examples of DO CoreStrengths: Useful / effective / realistic / solid / accurate <br />
      <br />
      How do these CoreStrengths already manifest, in your personal and school life?<br />
      Dream:<br />
      - I always have a lot of ideas and opinions on things and always see multiple ways of how something could be done.<br />
      - I like to make jokes, it takes away the edge from a lot of conversations.<br />
      - I like traveling in a unique way. I’m not always 100% enthusiastic in the moment but after the fact I always feel very satisfied after a travel journey.<br />
      <br />
      Do:<br />
      - I also have a very black and white vision of things and not a lot of grey in between. This fit’s with the Do strength since it makes me effective in making decisions.<br />
      - I always feel responsible to do my part of the job and will often take over parts that are left on the table, to make sure things get done.<br />
      <br />
      Had some tips and tricks on how to enable creative thinking. Listening to Music to enable not thinking inside the box but outside it.<br />
      that to truely think of something new, you need to step out of the standard brainstorming meeting feel, and get inspired. otherwise you just think of things you are already familiar with<br />
      <br />
      In the afternoon we had a Communal startup, talking about what we already did and what we took away from it.<br />
      We also talked about what intrigues us, and how we apply this in our individual project.<br />
      Worked on individual project. Looked more into the inner workings of how to make my project reality. <br />
      I made some drawings of a coordinate grid and how to calculate the score of a coordinate. <br />
      Next up is finding out how to recognize a dart and point it’s location.<br />

    Not everything is in there but the main idea is solidified in this document.<br /><br />
    In the afternoon I looked into the Github repo’s of already existing projects more and tinkered a bit with python to get an understanding of the written code.<br />
    I also made a logo for my project, because I thought it would add a nice touch.<br />
    I also realised I'm a bit stuck on how to start the programming for the project. <br />
    I talked with The feedback teacher for this day, He gave me a clear goal and helped to find out what the steps are I need to take to work towards a prototype.

Had a headache this morning because of sleep deprivation. Asked the teacher to record the teams meeting so I can look back at it in the afternoon.<br /><br />
In the afternoon I worked on setting up my prototype while listening to the teams meeting.<br />
The meeting explained in detail what is expected of us and how we should go about fulfilling those expectations.<br />
The expectation is a technical prototype (proof of concept) a little piece about my creative tech vision and something that tells the story of how my project came to be.<br />
I made a setup to test the things I’m trying to built and this setup is probably what I’m going to use for my proof of concept.<br />

    <h3 className="vertical-timeline-element-title">Concept questions answered</h3>
    <h4 className="vertical-timeline-element-subtitle">Continued tinkering with python</h4>
    <p>
    Still don’t really feel well, there was a workshop about connecting that I didn’t attend but I have read the assignment and created my own concept text.<br />
    <br />
    <b>What is the impact of your project? Can you enlarge it?</b><br />
    The impact my project gives is a more enjoyable dart experience for everyone that doesn’t play darts on a fully concentrated level. It’s a tedious job to keep track of score and removes a bit of the pleasure in just throwing. My project takes away that annoyance and improves the overall fun of the game for most players.
    I can enlarge the impact by making my project readily available and easy to install for other people to use. One of the easiest ways to do this is to make it open source and modular.<br />
    <br />
    <b>What does your process look like(creative + research based)?</b><br />
    I always start with forming an idea that provides a solution to something I experienced. After I have a general idea of how it should all be done, I will research how to exactly achieve the project outcome I want and then I’ll start building the project.<br />
    <br /><br />
    Further tinkering with the Dartboard camera setup I made in my room. I have had some problems with python using the wrong version and this caused some library issues.<br />
    I finally found the issue that has been annoying me for the last 2 days. I changed the python version that get’s used by macOS 2.7 to 3.9. Now I can use everything decently and hopefully start making some progress.<br />
    Since I’m not home tomorrow and don’t have access to the camera’s and feel like doing something a little more comfortable I’m planning on creating a Web API in python that would already do the game of darts.<br />

    <p>
    Today I’m going to build a part of the dart game itself so when I make the auto score detection with the cameras I can play a game of darts by feeding it the scores.<br />
    We had a small briefing about a potential project in cooperation with ACI = academy for creative industries.<br />
    The project has something to do with Volumetric video.<br />
    <br />
    Found this as a base to use for my web app scoring system <a href="https://github.com/ajaichemmanam/react-flask-socketio">https://github.com/ajaichemmanam/react-flask-socketio</a><br />
    <br />
    Started development on the web server / Web API that I want to use as the scoring module. It will have endpoints to call for score updates that the board code can call whenever a score get’s thrown.<br />
    <br />
    I also feel that I have been slacking a little bit this week. So I will work a bit more on my individual project Sunday afternoon and early evening.<br />

    <h3 className="vertical-timeline-element-title">Group meeting about what is expect for delivery</h3>
    <h4 className="vertical-timeline-element-subtitle">Working on the scoreboard web app</h4>
    <p>
      In the morning we had a meeting about how to deliver everything this week and some of the learning outcomes got explained to us all.<br />
      I asked a question about how to deliver documents and source code made. It is preferable if there are links in my portfolio to the documents.<br />
      <br />
      The whole afternoon i have been busy with sockets for my front-end scoreboard. Learned how to integrate the sockets,<br />
      Created a design draft of the front-end scoreboard.(adobe xD)<br />
      Still having problems concentrating on this project, I think it’s because the technical challenge is just out of my reach in this short time frame.<br />

    <h4 className="vertical-timeline-element-subtitle">Workshop about communication between devices</h4>
    <p>
    In the morning I worked on programming the web server, I decided to not use python for the back-end and just use nodeJS to be the Web API since I have more experience with node.<br /><br />
    In the afternoon we had a workshop about connections between devices.<br /> 
    This workshop also had a part where we needed to make our own connection for this I decided to use MQTT, I installed the Matt server / broker on the PI and connected to it via the Arduino with an Mqtt client. <br />
    To showcase this I also made use of my old smarhome project that can send updates to the Mqtt broker and receive updates from subscribed topics.<br />

    <p>
    In the morning I got some feedback on my portfolio. The feedback I got was directed at what to describe and how I should go about showcasing my project phases.<br />
    One of the criticisms, was my timeline having a little too much text to read. I will try and shorten this in a little bit. But I also think a full blown timeline with all things described in it adds a little unique flair.<br />
    <br />
    In the afternoon I worked on my portfolio project and cleaning it up and adding some of the stuff I got feedback on.<br />
    I’m making a separate page just describing my individual project phases, structured mostly the same as the timeline just with a different twist and some more images to make it easier on the eyes.<br />

    <p>
    Nothing done during the morning, I don’t feel that well.<br />
    <br />
    In the afternoon had a Workshop creative thinking part 2.<br />
    ￼<br />
    The workshop introduced us to a few different techniques to start a creative thinking process.
    <br />
    I looked a bit more into the camera detection, but I decided that I should make sure I have a presentation for tomorrow.<br />
    https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/05/25/basic-motion-detection-and-tracking-with-python-and-opencv/.<br />
    <br />
    I’m satisfied with the presentation I made. In the presentation I made clear what the things are that I learned during the 3 week period. <br />
    I described my failures and that in the end I wished that I had a better product to show for it. I’m not happy with the proof of concepts I made.<br />

    <h4 className="vertical-timeline-element-subtitle">& feedback from Geert Jan</h4>
    <p>
    We put all our inspirational ideas together and came up with a few potential projects we could make for the upcoming project.<br />
    One of our best ideas is probably a cloud that showcases the upcoming weather but can also show the mood of a given dataset.<br />
    For example a message group.<br />
    <br />
    After feedback from Geert Jan on the ideas we decided to go with the cloud, we called it WünderWolk and made a small project plan and formed questions for our research document.<br />
    There was some discussion between me and Bart about the research document because we both have different views of how a research document should look and be structured.<br /> 
    In the end we figured it out.<br />

    It was a really interesting lecture from a potential internship company, the presentation was mainly about marketing with IT and gave really nice insights.<br />

    <h3 className="vertical-timeline-element-title">Workshop about impact</h3>
    <h4 className="vertical-timeline-element-subtitle">Creating a powerpoint</h4>
    <p>
      In the morning we had a small workshop about the impact of projects you make. One of the questions asked is in what way does your project create impact. I think our WünderWolk project impact people with Freedom & Connection. <br />
      Because our project gives people a choice which gives them freedom and makes an emotional impact / connection via the social media / group chat feel visualization.<br />
      <br />
      Workshop how to create a scope of focus?<br />
      We had a little interaction and where given a small assignment to go more in-depth on our project and create a scope of focus. And write down the steps we made to scope our topic. <br />
      We did this together with the whole class as it appeared to be rather difficult to just get started with for most people in the class.<br />
      We got some more info about questions that can answer your compass.<br />
      ￼<br />
      We had some questions about our personal look on things.<br />
      <br />
      As a group we made a powerpoint for the presentation tomorrow.

    <p>
    During the morning we had a talk about our project planning with Mijke about what to do when.<br />
    It’s a quick meeting but it set us on the right track on what to do when.<br />
    We updated our trello board to have sprints. <br />
    After that we reviewed and tidied up our research document. That will guide us during the designing and prototyping of the product.<br />
    <br />
    We also had some quick fun with Wombo.ai.<br />
    <br />
    In the afternoon we had a workshop / meeting about the creative process from Geert Jan
    </p>
    <img src={icdp} height={200}></img>
    <p>
    It was a very interesting workshop and I really liked the timeline / chart that was designed by Geert Jan.<br />
    I will try and get us to follow this timeline in our trio project.<br />
    All the different phases got explained and also that it isn’t just a straight through timeline each phase could loop back into itself and you could even have a loop around the whole process.<br />
    <br />
    A few tips to also look into:<br />

    In the afternoon we each worked on our task in a call together. I finished version 1 of the App mock-up.<br />
    ￼<br />
    We also noticed we forgot to do the daily retrospect and summary, so we added those retroactively to the teams channel.<br />

      During the morning we worked on our final small tasks from this sprint week, and we had a very positive feedback meeting with Mijke.<br />
      She gave us the greet idea to connect mood and weather types to make it more visually appealing / special. The cloud is like a pet in your house.<br />
        It’s something that just happens naturally in the living room. Like a dog getting excited when everyone in the room get’s excited as well. <br />
        This is a really nice comparison by Bart and Mijke.<br />
        <br />
        Time left make a small document / visualization of happenings and the weather / emotion that fits with it.<br />
        <br />
        In the afternoon we started to make the product reality. By writing some first code.<br />
        Meeting with Geert Jan about demotivation of the semester.<br />
