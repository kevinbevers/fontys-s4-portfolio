All in all it was a very good feedback session for us.<br />\n    <br />\n    In the afternoon I first went for a walk with the dog to unload a bit from the busy morning.<br />\n    After that I received some feedback on my component diagram. I tweaked my diagram and continued the rest of the afternoon focussing on learning flutter.<br />\n    </p>\n  </VerticalTimelineElement>\n\n  <VerticalTimelineElement\n    className=\"vertical-timeline-element\"\n    contentStyle={{ background: 'rgb(220,220,220)' }}\n    contentArrowStyle={{ borderRight: '7px solid  rgb(220,220,220)' }}\n    date=\"1 April 2021\"\n    iconStyle={{ background: 'rgb(220,220,220)' }}\n    icon={<FaBook />}\n  >\n    <h3 className=\"vertical-timeline-element-title\">Research MQTT client in flutter</h3>\n    <h4 className=\"vertical-timeline-element-subtitle\">Created slider & got my PS5!!</h4>\n    <p>\n    During the morning I researched into MQTT client in flutter and looked into the slider widget and how it functions and how you can visualize it the way you want it to visualize.<br />\n    <br />\n    In the afternoon I continued my research into the Mqtt client and had a show & grow  meeting with the class. <br />\n    Where I told something about my way of working and exploring with flutter.<br />\n    After that meeting was finished.

After that I looked into the protocol to use and I have a good idea on how to do it based on the things I found online.<br /> \n      But I still have to convince my team members it’s the right approach. <br />\n      After that I tested my MQTT with an online broker and realized the code I implemented was semi deprecated and I switched to a newer version that also looks way cleaner and maintainable than the version I implemented earlier. <br />\n      All in all a sluggish day but stuff got done anyways.<br />\n    </p>\n    <img src={changing} height={250}></img>\n  </VerticalTimelineElement>\n\n  <VerticalTimelineElement\n    className=\"vertical-timeline-element\"\n    contentStyle={{ background: 'rgb(220,220,220)' }}\n    contentArrowStyle={{ borderRight: '7px solid  rgb(220,220,220)' }}\n    date=\"7 April 2021\"\n    iconStyle={{ background: 'rgb(220,220,220)' }}\n    icon={<FaMobile />}\n  >\n    <h3 className=\"vertical-timeline-element-title\">Finishing the App UI</h3>\n    <h4 className=\"vertical-timeline-element-subtitle\">Taking a look for my Internship period.</h4>\n    <p>\n      In the morning we as a group discussed what we where going to do for the day and I Decided to set goals to finish the full UI.<br />\n      One of the first things I wanted to find out was how to make my sliders and config menu look like the one that is native on IOS. <br />\n      I spend a good bit of time during the morning finding a nice library with good documentation so I could learn from it.<br />\n      <br />\n      In the afternoon I finished the complete UI except for the managing of subjects.<br />\n      I spend a good bit of time to look into the Internship canvas and I even solicited for 1.<br />\n      For the internship I also talked with my girlfriends father who is a partner in education and told me what is expected from students and what students can expect from the companies during an internship.<br />\n    </p>\n  </VerticalTimelineElement>\n\n  <VerticalTimelineElement\n    className=\"vertical-timeline-element\"\n    contentStyle={{ background: 'rgb(211,211,211)' }}\n    contentArrowStyle={{ borderRight: '7px solid  rgb(211,211,211)' }}\n    date=\"8 April 2021\"\n    iconStyle={{ background: 'rgb(211,211,211)' }}\n    icon={<FaComment />}\n  >\n    <h3 className=\"vertical-timeline-element-title\">Added final important part for UI</h3>\n    <h4 className=\"vertical-timeline-element-subtitle\">Feedback on group project and sememester coach meeting</h4>\n    <p>\n    In the morning I started working out how to go to a new page with a button and navigate back.
