My project takes away that annoyance and improves the overall fun of the game for most players.\n    I can enlarge the impact by making my project readily available and easy to install for other people to use.

I have had some problems with python using the wrong version and this caused some library issues.<br />\n    I finally found the issue that has been annoying me for the last 2 days. I changed the python version that get’s used by macOS 2.7 to 3.9. Now I can use everything decently and hopefully start making some progress.<br />\n    Since I’m not home tomorrow and don’t have access to the camera’s and feel like doing something a little more comfortable I’m planning on creating a Web API in python that would already do the game of darts.<br />\n    </p>\n  </VerticalTimelineElement>\n\n  <VerticalTimelineElement\n    className=\"vertical-timeline-element\"\n    contentStyle={{ background: 'rgb(211,211,211)' }}\n    contentArrowStyle={{ borderRight: '7px solid  rgb(211,211,211)' }}\n    date=\"5 March 2021\"\n    iconStyle={{ background: 'rgb(211,211,211)' }}\n    icon={<FaWindowRestore />}\n  >\n    <h3 className=\"vertical-timeline-element-title\">Working on individual project</h3>\n    <h4 className=\"vertical-timeline-element-subtitle\">Quick meeting about potential client project</h4>\n    <p>\n    Today I’m going to build a part of the dart game itself so when I make the auto score detection with the cameras I can play a game of darts by feeding it the scores.<br />\n    We had a small briefing about a potential project in cooperation with ACI = academy for creative industries.<br />\n    The project has something to do with Volumetric video.<br />\n    <br />\n    Found this as a base to use for my web app scoring system <a href=\"https://github.com/ajaichemmanam/react-flask-socketio\">https://github.com/ajaichemmanam/react-flask-socketio</a><br />\n    <br />\n    Started development on the web server / Web API that I want to use as the scoring module.

After reading I immediately thought of ways to show active listening without immediate judgement and prevent people from using a post as a means to an end.<br />\n    1. Show people that have seen / read it without judging. E.g. 420k people have read this and are still contemplating it’s meaning.<br />\n    2. Another extra emoji which is automatically given when someone has read a post but doesn’t feel the need to respond. It’s an ear of sorts showing someone has listened.<br />\n    3. The new social media features like twitters spaces. Where people can just talk like a podcast but people can request to speak and or can be invited to speak. Opens up more social interaction and gives people the option to just listen.<br /><br />\n    I’m not saying any of these ideas is a solution or even beneficial, it’s just some of my first thoughts while reading. Overall I really liked subject and the paper and I would like to read more about it in the future if interesting material is presented.\n    </p>\n  </VerticalTimelineElement>\n\n  <VerticalTimelineElement\n    className=\"vertical-timeline-element\"\n    contentStyle={{ background: 'rgb(211,211,211)' }}\n    contentArrowStyle={{ borderRight: '7px solid  rgb(211,211,211)' }}\n    date=\"27 May 2021\"\n    iconStyle={{ background: 'rgb(211,211,211)' }}\n    icon={<FaMarker />}\n  >\n    <h3 className=\"vertical-timeline-element-title\">Meeting with handpicked agencies.</h3>\n    <h4 className=\"vertical-timeline-element-subtitle\">Workshop critical thinking</h4>\n    <p>\n      Preparing our presentation and trying to make a few more models.

Then we had a feedback meeting with Judith about our project concept vision and how we can write it down. <br />\n    She also told us we should document our POC findings to use in our portfolio.<br />\n    <br />\n    In the afternoon I started working on some documentation for our project POC’s and concept vision. <br />\n    But before I started on that I briefly did a tour and joined the online STRP festival. <br />\n    There where some weird things in there I couldn’t really place what it was about.\n    </p>\n  </VerticalTimelineElement>\n\n  <VerticalTimelineElement\n    className=\"vertical-timeline-element\"\n    contentStyle={{ background: 'rgb(211,211,211)' }}\n    contentArrowStyle={{ borderRight: '7px solid  rgb(211,211,211)' }}\n    date=\"4 June 2021\"\n    iconStyle={{ background: 'rgb(211,211,211)' }}\n    icon={<FaFile />}\n  >\n    <h3 className=\"vertical-timeline-element-title\">POC documentation</h3>\n    <h4 className=\"vertical-timeline-element-subtitle\">Visting STRP festival again and preparing presentation.</h4>\n    <p>\n      Working with the guys on fixing / setting up our front end link to the POC.<br />\n      After that I continued work on the POC findings document.<br />\n      <br />\n      In the afternoon we went over our presentation for next week Monday.<br />\n      I also visited the STRP festival again and gave answer to the questions Eva asked.<br />\n      <br />\n      Which idea/concept/expression is resonating a clear vision according to you and why? <br />\n      The bar resonates a clear vision of the importance of communications and the different types one can communicate.<br />\n      <br />\n      Which idea/concept/expression is the most creative of all according to you and why? <br />\n      Acts In Translation by Dalena Tran. It’s a really cool concept because it plays into ambience of city sound. And the intend of the artwork was pretty clear to me compared to some other art works.<br />\n      <br />\n      What, at STRP, gave an extra insight/input to your own learning process of this specialisation semester? <br />\n      The only insight it really gave me is not to judge to early as this is something I sometimes do. Some artworks I wrote off in the beginning ended up being interesting.<br />\n    </p>\n  </VerticalTimelineElement>\n\n  <VerticalTimelineElement\n    className=\"vertical-timeline-element\"\n    contentStyle={{ background: 'rgb(220,220,220)' }}\n    contentArrowStyle={{ borderRight: '7px solid  rgb(220,220,220)' }}\n    date=\"7 June 2021\"\n    iconStyle={{ background: 'rgb(220,220,220)' }}\n    icon={<FaFile />}\n  >\n    <h3 className=\"vertical-timeline-element-title\">Meeting with client</h3>\n    <h4 className=\"vertical-timeline-element-subtitle\">Rewrote POC document and made an interaction flow</h4>\n    <p>\n    In the morning we had a meeting with handpicked to show our progress and discuss the next steps. <br />\n    The results of this meeting where useful.
